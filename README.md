# Petlify üê±üê∂

The animal shelter where you can find your favorite cat or dog breed and adopt, without buying from the pet store.
This is a Frontend mid-project as part of Appleseeds' Fullstack Bootcamp.

Petlify is a CRUD React App that consumes data from The cat API[https://thecatapi.com/] , and The Dog API[https://thedogapi.com/],
and performs CRUS actions on the data stored in Firestore database, which updates on real-time.
